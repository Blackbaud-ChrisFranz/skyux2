  Runs the
  <stache-code>test</stache-code> command and watches the file system for changes. The
  <stache-code>watch</stache-code> command monitors changes in much the same way as the
  <stache-code>serve</stache-code> command, but for testing, the
  <stache-code>watch</stache-code> command is always running, much like debug mode in Visual Studio. If you change a test, the window
  is watching that and runs the test. This command is useful when writing a bunch of tests.</p>
